Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, it creates a folder to store metadata so that it can track your repository. You need to initialize it so that all the files are in place to track your commits when you are ready.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a virtual place, whereas the working directory is a physical location on the drive. The staging area allows you to control what you commit, rather than committing everything at once.
